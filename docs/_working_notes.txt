Working Notes

I am trying to get rid of the homepage component, because all that it has is the top ten reviews component in it.
There are a lot of links to it, so I've got to change those over.
No reason to have a component that's fully empty.

So TopTenTable is going to replace homepage.
What would be easier is actually just put all of the logic that's currently in TopTenComponent and move that into homepage component, that way I don't need to change all of the linking and routes, and also homepage makes more sense there.
TopTenTable is just descriptive about what is in that page, don't need separate components.
This is a mistake that I made too on my first run through the application.  

Moved all of the logic, markup, styling from TopTen over to HomePage, deleted TopTen.  

Created service for the get from Firebase. Implemented unsubscribe with takeWhile() Boolean.
OnDestroy sets `isAlive` boolean from true to false.
